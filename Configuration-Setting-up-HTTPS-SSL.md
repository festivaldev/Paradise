# Setting up HTTPS/SSL
By default, both the Web Services and the File Server are configured to run via HTTPS on `localhost`, ports `8080` and `8081` respectively. Support for HTTPS can be disabled (although not recommended) by setting `EnableSSL` to `false` in `ParadiseSettings.Server.xml`. (See [[Server Configuration|Configuration-Server]])

To allow your own server to be accessed via HTTPS, you need your SSL certificate [imported into Windows Certificate Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/adding-certificates-to-the-certificates-store-on-the-client). You also need to bind the certificates to the ports you're running the servers on, either by using [`netsh`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate?redirectedfrom=MSDN) or a little tool called [HttpConfig](http://www.stevestechspot.com/default.aspx). When binding a certificate to a port, always use `0.0.0.0` as the IP address.  
The domain or IP address the server is allowing connections to from UberStrike is configured using `WebServiceHostName` and `FileServerHostName` in `ParadiseSettings.Server.xml`. The SSL certificate's subject (`CN=...`) **must** match the hostname for each server!
